*IMPORTANT, DO THIS BEFORE YOU ATTEMPT TO RUN!*

To get this program to run correctly:
1) Make a package called "bipod"

2) place the files within.

2a) The files are named such things as head + tentacle. Head is location of main. Tentacle is a part that plugs
into head. The number of tentacles is directly related to the numerical indicator in the package name
(i.e. bipod = 2 feet = two required tentacles).
You can think of them as arms too, whatever really. What matters is they're not main, but required by.

3) make sure "stats.txt" is in the right place.

3a) Thankfully, the program will error and display the file path to where it wants the file at if it's not there

4) Done. Program is ready to run.
